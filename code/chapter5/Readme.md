# DataSets

We will need to use datasets in this section to demonstrate concepts. Most MySQL database samples, including  the ones supplied by Oracle have very strict licensing.  For the purpose of chapter 5, I am using data from http://fivethirtyeight.com/ located at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data. They are supplying data with a Commons Creative License, also it is simplified, clean and easy to use.
